Simple weather station

Using D1 Mini NodeMCU ESP8266 module plus generic DHT shield to get temperatore and humidity and post to Weather Underground (wunderground.com).

This is my first ESP8266 project.

See the project's wiki for more discursive explanations. https://github.com/jmcgnh/WeatherStation01/wiki
